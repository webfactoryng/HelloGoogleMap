Let’s say you have a table called `stations`, with a primary key called `id` and the station’s `name`, additionaly the coordinates are saved in `latitude` and `longitude`. Here’s how you do your query:


SELECT
`id`,
`name`,
ACOS( SIN( RADIANS( `latitude` ) ) * SIN( RADIANS( $fLat ) ) + COS( RADIANS( `latitude` ) ) * COS( RADIANS( $fLat )) * COS( RADIANS( `longitude` ) - RADIANS( $fLon )) ) * 6380 AS `distance`
FROM `stations`
WHERE
ACOS( SIN( RADIANS( `latitude` ) ) * SIN( RADIANS( $fLat ) ) + COS( RADIANS( `latitude` ) )
* COS( RADIANS( $fLat )) * COS( RADIANS( `longitude` ) - RADIANS( $fLon )) ) * 6380 < 10
ORDER BY `distance`

where $fLat is the searchers latitude and $fLon the searchers longitude. The ten in the where clause is the range you want to search within. Remember: This search is based on kilometers. If you want to search in miles, you need to change the 6380 (whoch is our earths radius) to its respective value in miles. That’s it! You now got your result set with all stations in the ambit of ten kilometers.
